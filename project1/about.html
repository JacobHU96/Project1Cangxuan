        <p>Make no mistake about it, Hokkaido is big. Very big. Distances are vast, the landscape wild and untamed and the weather can change at the drop of a hat. That’s what makes planning your Hokkaido itinerary so difficult.</p>

        <p>The best way to get around Hokkaido is by renting a car. Hokkaido does offer a JR pass, but services to the major national parks are limited and even then you will still need to take a bus or taxi to get into the parks proper.</p>

    <td style="font-size:40px">When it comes to Hokkaido tourist attractions, sightseeing is a must. If you love color, then you’ll love the lavender fields at Farm Tomita in Furano.
      <br>It’s only a 45 minute drive by car from Asahikawa Airport. The best time of the year to visit this attraction is from July to early August.
          If you love the color purple, then this is a must do.</td>
